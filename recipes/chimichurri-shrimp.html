<h2>Description</h2>

<p>For this <strong>chimichurri shrimp</strong>, I made the chimichurri sauce from scratch for the first time, and boy am I glad I did. 
    I used fresh oregano instead of dried, and I love how it turned out and think you will too. This <em>zesty herb-based</em> sauce is packed with flavor.
     Serve with crusty bread to soak up the <em>delicious</em> blend of herbs and olive oil.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>Chimichurri Sauce</h3>
    <li>1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>5 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1/2 shallot, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh oregano</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black or white pepper</li>

    <h3>Shrimp</h3>
   
    <li>1 pound jumbo or large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>For chimichurri, add parsley, garlic, shallot, oregano, red pepper, olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper to a bowl; stir well to combine. 
        Allow to sit for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour to allow flavors to develop.</li>
    
    <li>To marinate shrimp, add peeled shrimp to a large bowl. Add olive oil, honey, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. 
        Mix well to coat shrimp. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>

    <li>Heat a griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. 
        Once hot, add shrimp in a single layer. Cook for 3 minutes on each side. You may have to work in batches.</li>
    
    <li>Put cooked shrimp in a bowl, spoon a generous amount of chimichurri sauce over the shrimp and toss to coat shrimp.</li>

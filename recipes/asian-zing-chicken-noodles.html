<h2>Description</h2>

<p>These slow cooker Asian zing chicken noodles are amazing—so much flavor with so little effort. 
    Chicken thighs, slow-cooked in <em>sweet spicy chili-soy-ginger</em> zing sauce, are <strong>shredded</strong> and tossed with quick-cooking fresh lo mein noodles. 
    If your comfort food tends to the spicy, this is for you.</p>

    <li>1 bunch green onions, sliced, for garnish</li>
